## Overview

### The Project

Users should be able to:

- All spaces, sizes and colors must be in accordance with the layout and requirements.
- Slight differences with the layout are allowed in the size, spaces.
- The page should display correctly in all modern browsers.
- The page is adaptive and available in three main variants:
    - Desktop - screen size more than 1280px;
    - Tablet - screen size from 992px to 1279px;
    - Smartphone - screen size from 320px to 991px.
- Within each screen option, the "rubber" layout, that is, the width of the elements, changes proportionally to the screen width.
- All interface decisions that are not considered in the layout are made by the programmer.
- The project should be organized as follows:
    - The HTML page uses an external style file in the project folder;
    - HTML inline styling is not allowed;
    - Images are placed in a separate folder.
- The project must pass the Validator check.
- Correct layout semantics must be observed.
- The Page Code should be stored in the GitHub repository.

## My process

### Built with

- Technologys

  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  - SASS

- Pattern Sass 7 in 1 pattern `Fixed it for MySelf`

### Note for Better UnderStanding

- All Project's code Organized I mean that Beautify, Readable, Understandable.

- In this Project writen with BEM Methodology.

- I use pure HTML & CSS only and write everything from scratch,
  Don't used utilize any no code tools like Wix, Wordpress etc.

- And i used CSS preprocessors `SASS`, By the way i provide a readme file with instructions for you how to run it.

  - I used some extensions to compile the codes in `main.scss` into main.css, I mean all scss files are imported into `main.scss` file, so you can see all css codes in `main.css`.

  - css
    - main.css
