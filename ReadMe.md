## Overview

### The Project

Users should be able to:

- All spaces, sizes and colors must be in accordance with the layout and requirements.
- Slight differences with the layout are allowed in the size, spaces.
- The page should display correctly in all modern browsers.
- The page is adaptive and available in three main variants:
  - Desktop - screen size more than 1280px;
  - Tablet - screen size from 992px to 1279px;
  - Smartphone - screen size from 320px to 991px.
- Within each screen option, the "rubber" layout, that is, the width of the elements, changes proportionally to the screen width.
- All interface decisions that are not considered in the layout are made by the programmer.
- The project should be organized as follows:
  - The HTML page uses an external style file in the project folder;
  - HTML inline styling is not allowed;
  - Images are placed in a separate folder.
- The project must pass the Validator check.
- Correct layout semantics must be observed.
- The Page Code should be stored in the GitHub repository.

### Note for Better UnderStanding

- In this Project writen with BEM Methodology.
- We only used pure HTML and CSS and a bit of Bootstrap for Resposivity, we write everything from scratch,
  Don't used utilize any no code tools like Wix, Wordpress etc.
- We used Visual Studio Code while writing code and a bit of extensions like "Prettier", "Bootstrap 5 Quick Snippets", "Live Server" to write more productive code . . .
